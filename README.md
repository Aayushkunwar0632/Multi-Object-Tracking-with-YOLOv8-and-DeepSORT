# Multi-Object Tracking with YOLOv8 and DeepSORT

## Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time multi-object tracking system using YOLOv8 for object detection and DeepSORT for tracking. The integration of these two state-of-the-art models enables robust object detection and tracking in video sequences.

## Features
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for detecting objects in each frame of the video.
- **Multi-Object Tracking**: Employs DeepSORT to track multiple objects across video frames.
- **Customizable**: Easily switch between different YOLO models and adjust tracking parameters.
- **Performance Optimization**: Video compression to reduce file size for easier sharing and storage.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
